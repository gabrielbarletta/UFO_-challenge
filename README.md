## 1. Overview of the analysis: 
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.


## 3.Summary:
* One drawback could be that we are limited to searching our data in only one JavaScript File. 
* As a recommended action, we could improve data accuracy by creating dropdown lists for the user to choose from.
* I could also add another area in which users add their own UFO sightings.
